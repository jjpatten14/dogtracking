# Boundary System Issues Documentation

## Overview
This document tracks the boundary coordinate mismatch issue discovered on 2025-07-09 and the debugging/fixes implemented.

## Issue Description
When loading saved boundaries, they appeared with visual distortion and coordinate mismatches. The boundaries didn't align properly between client canvas overlay and server video stream rendering.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem: Memory vs File Boundary Conflict
The coordinate mismatch was caused by boundaries existing in **BOTH** memory and file simultaneously:

- **Memory boundaries** (`boundary_list`): Used directly by server with original pixel coordinates
- **File boundaries** (`boundary_config.json`): Loaded by client with coordinate conversion
- **Result**: Double-drawing with mismatched coordinate systems

### Technical Flow That Caused Issues:

1. **During Save**:
   - User draws boundary ‚Üí Client has normalized coordinates (0-1)
   - Client gets video dimensions ‚Üí Converts to pixel coordinates  
   - Client sends pixel coordinates to server ‚Üí Server saves to `boundary_list` (memory)
   - User clicks "Save All to File" ‚Üí Server saves `boundary_list` to `boundary_config.json`
   - **Problem**: Boundaries now exist in BOTH memory and file

2. **During Load**:
   - Server renders boundaries from memory (`boundary_list`) using original pixel coordinates
   - Client loads boundaries from file ‚Üí Converts pixel coordinates back to normalized
   - Client renders boundaries on canvas using converted coordinates
   - **Result**: Two different coordinate sets = visual mismatch

### Why Normal Drawing Worked:
- During normal boundary creation, coordinates flow: Client ‚Üí Server memory ‚Üí Server rendering
- No file conversion involved, so no coordinate conversion errors
- Single rendering path = consistent coordinates

### Why Server Restart "Fixed" It:
- Server restart cleared in-memory `boundary_list`
- Only file boundaries remained (single coordinate system)
- No double-drawing = no visual mismatch

## Debug Logging Added

### Server-Side (`app.py`):
- **Removed**: Per-frame boundary drawing spam (30 FPS logging)
- **Added**: Detailed save boundary coordinate logging in `/save_boundary` endpoint
- **Logs**: Video dimensions, pixel coordinates, frame bounds validation

### Client-Side (`boundary-drawing.js`):
- **Added**: Detailed load boundary coordinate logging in `loadSavedBoundaries()`
- **Logs**: Video dimensions, canvas dimensions, coordinate conversion steps
- **Traces**: Pixel ‚Üí normalized ‚Üí canvas coordinate flow

## Current Status

### Fixed:
‚úÖ **Logging spam removed** - No more per-frame debug output  
‚úÖ **Coordinate debugging added** - Detailed logging for save/load operations  
‚úÖ **Issue temporarily resolved** - Server restart cleared memory conflict  

### Still Needs Fixing:
‚ö†Ô∏è **Root cause remains** - Memory vs file boundary conflict not permanently fixed  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Will reoccur** - Issue will happen again when boundaries exist in both memory and file  

## Proposed Permanent Fix

### Strategy: Clear Memory After Save-to-File
1. **Modify "Save All to File" button**:
   - After successful file save, clear in-memory `boundary_list`
   - Make file the single source of truth for persistent boundaries
   - Prevent memory vs file conflicts

2. **Update coordinate flow**:
   - Memory: Only for temporary/active drawing
   - File: Only for persistent/saved boundaries
   - No simultaneous existence in both

### Files to Modify:
- `boundary-drawing.js`: Update `saveBoundary()` to clear server memory after file save
- `app.py`: Add endpoint to clear memory boundaries after file save

## Test Cases for Tomorrow

1. **Test coordinate consistency**:
   - Draw boundary ‚Üí Save to file ‚Üí Load from file
   - Verify client and server boundaries align perfectly

2. **Test save/load cycle**:
   - Create multiple boundaries ‚Üí Save all ‚Üí Restart server ‚Üí Load
   - Ensure no coordinate drift or visual mismatches

3. **Test memory clearing**:
   - Save boundaries ‚Üí Verify memory cleared ‚Üí Load ‚Üí Verify single rendering

## Technical Notes

### Video Dimensions:
- Current camera: 2304√ó1296 (actual frame size)
- Canvas: Variable size based on display
- Coordinate conversion: Normalized (0-1) ‚Üî Pixel coordinates

### Coordinate Conversion Chain:
```
User Click ‚Üí Canvas Pixels ‚Üí Normalized (0-1) ‚Üí Server Pixels ‚Üí File Storage
File Storage ‚Üí Server Pixels ‚Üí Normalized (0-1) ‚Üí Canvas Pixels ‚Üí Display
```

### Key Learning:
The double-drawing was **intentional for debugging** - user wanted to see both client and server boundaries to verify alignment. The issue wasn't the double-drawing itself, but the coordinate mismatch between them.

## Log Examples

### Successful Save (2025-07-09):
```
üíæ ===== SAVE BOUNDARY COORDINATE DEBUG =====
üì∫ Server video dimensions during save: 2304x1296
üì• Received 4 boundary points from client:
   Point 1: pixel(1685, 308)
   Point 2: pixel(955, 315)
   Point 3: pixel(1031, 770)
   Point 4: pixel(2097, 704)
‚úÖ Boundary saved to server (total: 1)
```

### System Status:
- Camera resolution: 2304√ó1296 (no forced resize for better performance)
- Dynamic coordinate system: ‚úÖ Working
